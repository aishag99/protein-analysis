# protein-analysis
Proteins are sequences of amino acids that fold into specific structures, playing key roles in cells. Proteomics is the large-scale study of proteins, often using techniques like mass spectrometry or X-ray crystallography to analyze them.
# Protein Analysis with Machine Learning

This project focuses on analyzing protein sequences and structures using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to predict protein functions or structures by applying techniques like decision trees, SVMs, and neural networks.
